<p>ZooTraits is an R Shiny App for exploring animal trait data for Ecological and Evolutionary Research.</p> <p>This app serves as a tool to summarize information on traits and provide users with access to the available trait databases.</p> <p>In addition, users are invited to upload trait data to feed the ZooTraits app, which acts as a continuous tool to update data in the review provided by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.10016">Gon√ßalves-Souza et al. (2023)</a>.</p> <p>Consequently, this app also provides a global overview of traits used in animal ecology.</p> <p>By using this app, researchers can navigate the multitude of traits more efficiently and make informed decisions based on their specific research interests and study areas.</p>
