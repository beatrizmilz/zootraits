ZooTraits is an R Shiny App for exploring animal trait data for Ecological and Evolutionary Research.

This app serves as a tool to summarize information on traits and provide users with access to the available trait databases. 

In addition, users are invited to upload trait data to feed the ZooTraits app, which acts as a continuous tool to update data in the review provided by [Gon√ßalves-Souza et al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.10016). 

Consequently, this app also provides a global overview of traits used in animal ecology. 

By using this app, researchers can navigate the multitude of traits more efficiently and make informed decisions based on their specific research interests and study areas.
